# Association Rule Mining on Grocery Purchase Data

This R project applies the **Apriori algorithm** to a real world grocery dataset to uncover meaningful product associations. The aim is to analyze which items are frequently purchased together and visualize common buying patterns.
Dataset sourced from Kaggle contains **9835 transactions** with up to 32 items

I have used inbuilt **arules** and **arulesViz** R Packages for Apriori algorithm

And Extracted results into 3 CSV files using **Write** Function  for 3 different support values also created an  **Interactive Graph** plot for the 10 frequent itemsets using inbuilt **htmlwidget** in R plot() function
